Since i was a child I’ve always loved technology, always taking things apart putting them back together. I was the computer savy kid in the family, always on my compaq whether it was playing games, downloading music on limewire, or checking to see if I had new messages on myspace. Fast forward, I’ve been blessed to have learned the inner workings of the internet and software. Started out building a command-line tic tac toe game, today building full websites."
